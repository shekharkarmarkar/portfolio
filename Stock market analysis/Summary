This project is done by me in whole.
When we invest in stock market with some broker, we get dashboard to show how our portfolio performs.
But for monitoring stocks in which we have not invested, there is not good tool.
I have created this tool to monitor any number of stocks on daily or real time basis.
It shows how stocks perform at one click.
It shows 25 stocks graphs in one click.
It shows how stocks are moving
I have created a tool to show stocks 52 weeks movement related to high and low.
This all helps to monitor our selected portfolio without paying any fees to broker or any third party.
It maintains privacy of our stock picking.
I paired all these tools with excel files to make it very easy to use.
