This project of loan analysis is based on data from a bank. The data gives de-identified information about loan cases. 
My job was to create analysis to predict loan defaults from available information.
I used logistic regression analysis to flag cases which has more possibility of default.
This project showcase use of R, lot of statistical tests and logistic regression analysis .
